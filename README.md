Adding changes:
- add new content in master repo
- run "hugo" using command line to generate a build directory called `public`
- copy `public` to the `prod` branch

If running into a 404 on cyheffley.com:
- verify that the CNAME file exists in the `prod` branch (and that its contents are just cyheffley.com)
