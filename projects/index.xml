      <title>Long-Form Diarization for Predicting Podcast Speakers</title>

      <description>About Speaker diarization is &amp;ldquo;the process of partitioning an input audio stream into homogeneous segments according to the speaker identity&amp;rdquo; (Wikipedia).
Plenty of services exist today for diarizing speakers at a local level: given an audio file, services such as AssemblyAI&amp;rsquo;s Speech-to-Text API, Amazon Transcribe, and Google&amp;rsquo;s Speech-to-Text can provide diarization for the speakers within that audio file.
As a machine learning engineering intern at SpareMin, I developed and prototyped what we believe to be the first service for diarizing speakers across entire podcast feeds.</description>

      <description>About Originally an annually-published book that dates back to at least the 1970&amp;rsquo;s, Course Critique is a static web application owned by Georgia Tech&amp;rsquo;s Student Government Association. Critique allows users to view historical course grade distributions across all instructors and courses offered at Georgia Tech.
I served in Georgia Tech&amp;rsquo;s SGA as team owner for Critique&amp;rsquo;s development team from 2018 until 2020, where I spent a year as SGA&amp;rsquo;s Vice President of IT, a role that involved a few policy-driven responsibilities in addition to overseeing maintenance and development for projects such as Critique.</description>

      <description>About CyComics is a free subscription service for viewing daily comics through e-mail.
Subscribers can use a Google form to manage their personalized comics page and control which days of the week they receive comics in their inbox.
Currently, there are about 70 subscribers that can choose between about 75 different comics.
I built the first iteration of this project in an afternoon in 2020 while I was procrastinating on some schoolwork, but I&amp;rsquo;ve tinkered with the project on and off for general maintenance and optimizing for readability and scalability.</description>

      <description>About Check out Find My Microwave here.
This website tracks microwave ovens across Georgia Tech so that students can burn popcorn and meet firefighters heat up food around campus. It&amp;rsquo;s built with Bootstrap and Google Maps&#39; Static API, and includes a form for submitting locations or feedback through e-mail.
This website was my first exposure to coding and was built in January 2017 at Georgia Tech&amp;rsquo;s HackGTeeny event.
You can check out our source code here.</description>

      <title>Video Subtitle Bot [Inactive]</title>
      <link>https://cyheffley.com/projects/subtitle_bot/</link>

      <description>About This bot is no longer active due to another Twitter caption bot already being available: HeadlinerClip Caption.
When mentioned in reply to a video of up to 140 seconds long on Twitter, this bot would reply with an automatically-captioned copy of the video. Captioning was done with GCP Speech-to-Text, and our server was built using tweepy.
We additionally included a data integrity measure: every 10 minutes, all original video tweets were checked to ensure that they were still publicly accessible.</description>
