## About

CyComics is a free subscription service for viewing daily comics through e-mail.

Subscribers can use a Google form to manage their personalized comics page and control which days of the week they receive comics in their inbox.

Currently, there are about 70 subscribers that can choose between about 75 different comics.

I built the first iteration of this project in an afternoon in 2020 while I was procrastinating on some schoolwork, but I've tinkered with the project on and off for general maintenance and optimizing for readability and scalability.

Currently the project is built entirely in Python using Beautiful Soup 4 and Python's built-in SMTP module. The webscraping and mail distribution runs each morning on a Raspberry Pi.

If you're interested in subscribing, reach out to me through my [Contact page.](/contact)
