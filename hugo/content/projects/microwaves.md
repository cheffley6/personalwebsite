## About

Check out Find My Microwave [here.](https://tsuwoto.github.io/)

This website tracks microwave ovens across Georgia Tech so that students can ~~burn popcorn and meet firefighters~~ heat up food around campus. It's built with Bootstrap and Google Maps' Static API, and includes a form for submitting locations or feedback through e-mail.

This website was my first exposure to coding and was built in January 2017 at Georgia Tech's HackGTeeny event.

You can check out our source code [here.](https://github.com/tsuwoto/tsuwoto.github.io)
