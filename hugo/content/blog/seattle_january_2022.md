Just wrapped up visiting a few friends and checking out the city of Seattle for the first time. Here are some photos I took from across the city this weekend.

## Scenery

| ![](/img/seattle/views_gum_wall.jpg) |

| The infamous gum wall. Apparently the tradition of placing chewed gum here started in 1993, and the wall wasn't cleaned for the first time until 2015. I was told by locals that it now gets power-washed every few months. |

|:--:|
| Ice cream from Indigo Cow, the only shop in the country that uses milk from Japan's island of [Hokkaido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido) for soft serve. This was some of the best ice cream I've ever had; the mochi and brown sugar syrup was a great addition. |

## MoPOP

Seattle's Museum of Pop Culture.

| ![](/img/seattle/mopop_if_vi_was_ix.JPG) |

| Guitar sculpture called _IF VI WAS IX._ It's supposed to play music, but I didn't hear anything while I was there. |

| ![](/img/seattle/mopop_mf_doom_mask.jpg) |
|:--:|
| The caption here is "MF DOOM MASK - LOAN COURTESY OF ERNIE PANICCIOLI" - I haven't been able to find any more details about this specific mask, but I'm assuming it was used for a photo shoot that the two did. |
