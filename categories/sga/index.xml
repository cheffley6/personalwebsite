      <description>About Originally an annually-published book that dates back to at least the 1970&amp;rsquo;s, Course Critique is a static web application owned by Georgia Tech&amp;rsquo;s Student Government Association. Critique allows users to view historical course grade distributions across all instructors and courses offered at Georgia Tech.
I served in Georgia Tech&amp;rsquo;s SGA as team owner for Critique&amp;rsquo;s development team from 2018 until 2020, where I spent a year as SGA&amp;rsquo;s Vice President of IT, a role that involved a few policy-driven responsibilities in addition to overseeing maintenance and development for projects such as Critique.</description>
